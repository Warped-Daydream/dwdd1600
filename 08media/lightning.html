    <main>
        <h1>Lightning</h1>
        <h2>Category Rules</h2>
        <p>As many of the sub elements can be arranged to be under just about any of the main for (more or less) I've
            come up with some baseline rules as to what elements can go in this category:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>If it is related to electricity, the sky, or is associated with either, it's lightning</li>
            <li>If it requires other of the main 4 elements, is closer related to other main 4 elements, or has lightning as
                a sub of its own abilities, it's not lightning.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>short and sweet, I know, but it works quite well.</p>
        <h2>Elements and Elemental Masters Under Lightning</h2>
