        <h1>History</h1>
        <h2>Ancient Ninjago</h2>
        <p>Long ago, the continent of &copy;Ninjago was created by the First Spinjitzu Master - a half dragon, half oni hybrid from the realm of dragons and oni. He did so utilizing both his own powers, and four golden weapons that each held the power of one of the main four elements - <em>Fire</em>, <strong>&bull;Earth&bull;</strong>, <strong>Ice</strong>, and <em>Lightning</em>.</p>
        <p>These four elements also ended up having human masters who could wield them once &copy;Ninjago was populated, and more of these 'elemental masters' popped up over time. (This is theoretical, of course, as the origins of elements and elemental powers are not confirmed within the show.) Long after the First Spinjitzu Master was dead, having passed on the art of Spinjitzu and the golden weapons to his two sons, a war broke out between the humans and serpentine (aka, snake people.) All the elemental masters banded together to take down the serpentine, trapping them in underground tombs.</p>
        <h2>Modern Ninjago</h2>
        <p>In the modern times of &copy;Ninjago, the main four elements have clear weilders, and they meet other elemental masters throughout their journey - primarily season 4 - and there are quite a few, many even not accounted for in the previous war.</p>
