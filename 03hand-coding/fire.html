        <h2>Category Rules</h2>
        <p>As many of the sub elements can be arranged to be under just about any of the main for (more or less) I've come up with some baseline rules as to what elements can go in this category:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>If it is related to creating heat and/or light, it's fire</li>
            <li>If it requires other of the main 4 elements, is closer related to other main 4 elements, or has fire as a sub of its own abilities, it's not fire.</li>
            <li>If it's Lightning, it's a main 4 element and does not count here.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>short and sweet, I know, but it works quite well.</p>
        <h2>Elements and Elemental Masters Under Fire</h2>
        <dl>
            <dt>Fire</dt>
            <dd>The elemental power of creating and controlling (to an extent) fire. Weilded in the Serpentine War by a man named Ray and currently wielded by his son: Kai.</dd>
            <dt>Smoke</dt>
            <dd>The elemental power of turning oneself into smoke - allowing the user to basically teleport themself short distances or become intangible to evade attack. While this element is not seen during the Serpentine War, it is currently weilded by a man named Ash.</dd>
            <dt>Light</dt>
            <dd>The elemental power of light - both can create a beam of light and can turn the user invisible. Though it was not seen during the Serpentine War, it is currently weilded by a man that goes only by 'Mr. Pale.' This one is here and not under Lightning because I wanted Lightning to be more focused on the sky and on energy.</dd>
